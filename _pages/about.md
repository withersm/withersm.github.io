I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in Physics at Stanford University, where I work with Professor [Chao-Lin Kuo](https://profiles.stanford.edu/chao-lin-kuo?tab=bio) to develop instrumentation for axion detection and cosmic microwave background observation. 

I received an M.S. in Physics from Stanford in 2025. Before that, I received a B.S. in Physics from Washington and Lee University, where I worked with Professors [Dan Mazilu](https://www.wlu.edu/profile/mazilu-dan) and [Irina Mazilu](https://www.wlu.edu/profile/mazilu-irina) to manipulate and model the self assembly of silicon nanoparticles. 

My current research focuses on developing high volume resonators for detecting axion dark matter at gigahertz frequencies. Axions are a candidate dark matter particle which should convert (weakly!) to photons inside a strong magnetic field. I'm building a new "axion haloscope," which uses a resonant cavity inspired by the geometry of beehives to detect these photons. This geometry allows the cavity to efficiently probe a wide range of frequencies above between 2 and 10 GHz, where traditional cylindrical cavities slow down as they shrink to match the photons' cm-scale wavelength. This work is part of ADMX-vERA, a working group in the [Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX)](https://depts.washington.edu/admx/) that focuses on designing, building, and testing creative cavity geometries. I'm also developing the analysis code for ADMX's upcoming Run 2A, which will feature four cylindrical axion haloscopes scanning in unison.

I'm also working with the AliCPT collaboration to develop [AliCPT-1](https://www.nist.gov/measuring-cosmos/asia/ali-cmb-polarization-telescope-alicpt), a small aperture telescope which will measure polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at 95 and 150 GHz from the Tibetan Plateau. The CMB is a redshifted surface of thermal radiation that was released at recombination: the moment when the universe cooled enough for atoms to form. It contains imprints of the nature of the early universe. Through details of its polarization, we hope to measure primordial gravitiational waves, the details of which can be used to constrain models of cosmic inflation. I have focused on integrating the experiment's first microwave-multiplexed detector module (built by NIST Boulder) with RFSoC-based readout electronics from Arizona State University. 

You can read more about my research on the Research tab above. You can see a full listing of my academic activities under the CV tab. My peer-reviewed publications and conference procedings are listed under Publications.
